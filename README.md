## Project Overview
This project explores automated design solutions for SOC wireless transceivers operating in the RF frequency range of 2.5â€“7 GHz. The focus was on optimizing three key circuit blocks:
- **Current Mirror**: Ensures the output current matches the reference current with minimal variation.
- **Second-Order Low-Pass Filter (LPF)**: Tuned to achieve specific frequency response characteristics.
- **Differential Amplifier**: Optimized to maximize gain while adhering to design constraints.

The project leverages optimization algorithms, scripting for automation, and advanced simulation techniques to enhance efficiency and performance.

## Key Features
- **Automation Tools**: Integrated Ocean Script and Skill for automated design and optimization.
- **Optimization Algorithms**: Employed Gradient Descent and Newton's Method to fine-tune component values.
- **Data-Driven Design**: Utilized CSV-based data analysis to refine results and guide future optimizations.
- **Design Compliance**: Ensured adherence to constraints such as gain, cutoff frequency, and SNR for RF circuits.

## Files and Structure
- **`current_mirror/`**: Contains the current mirror design and optimization scripts.
- **`low_pass_filter/`**: Includes LPF schematics, simulations, and Ocean Script files.
- **`differential_amplifier/`**: Holds design files and optimization results for the amplifier.
- **`scripts/`**: Automation scripts for running simulations and exporting results.
- **`results/`**: CSV files and logs documenting simulation outputs and optimization progress.

## Methodology
1. **Simulation Setup**:
   - Designed schematics using Cadence Virtuoso.
   - Configured global variables and test setups for DC, AC, and noise analyses.

2. **Optimization**:
   - Applied iterative techniques to fine-tune component values.
   - Exported Ocean Script files for automation and executed SKILL scripts for variable substitution.

3. **Data Analysis**:
   - Processed simulation results in CSV format for systematic evaluation and refinement.

4. **Performance Evaluation**:
   - Compared outputs against target metrics such as cutoff frequency, gain, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

## Results
- Achieved:
  - Precise current matching for the current mirror.
  - Targeted frequency response for the LPF with high SNR and rejection.
  - Maximum gain for the differential amplifier within specified constraints.

- Tools and methods proved effective in enhancing design automation and reducing manual intervention.

## Future Work
- Explore advanced optimization techniques like Accelerated Proximal Gradient Descent (APGD).
- Integrate machine learning models to predict optimal configurations and streamline the design process.
- Expand the scope to include additional circuit blocks and higher frequency ranges.
